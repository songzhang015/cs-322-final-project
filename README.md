README.md to be updated...

This project is intended to be the MVP and final project for CS 322 at the University of Oregon.

The goal of this project is to implement the core functionality of another planned project intended
to be built sometime in 2026 using React, Node.js (and Express), and MongoDB as a personal project.

This version will be built using the concepts taught in the CS 322 course and will use HTML, CSS,
vanilla Javascript, Flask, and MongoDB. Additionally, it will use Docker.

In this MVP, users will be able to take turns drawing a prompt as other users attempt to guess your prompt.
As a guesser, you will try to guess the drawing before anyone else guesses it while as a drawer, you
are trying to get guessers to type your prompt out as quickly as possible.

Existing versions of this project idea can be played online already, but it's meant to be a minimally
working version to aid in another planned project later on.
